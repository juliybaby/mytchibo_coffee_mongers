Coffee Mongers

How To Test the Application:
This application was written in PHP, Ajax, JQUERY, Bootstraps, Css, Mysql etc.

 You will need Xampp Server with Mysql Database installed to run the application.

1.) Locate the database table called coffee-monger_db.SQL and import it to your database
2.) Edit data6rst.php to reflect your database credentials
4.) Edit t_sms.php and t_email.php to add sms and Email user credentials respectively. For sms, we are using our Local paid
SMS GATEWAYS
5.)Unzip Vendor Folders inside the main application folder. I zipped vendor folder because github web interface uploads can only accept maximum files of 100 uploads. 
The vendor folder is due to the fact that we leverage PHPMAILER for email processing.
6.) callup the application on the browser Eg http://localhost/coffee-mongerings/index.php
